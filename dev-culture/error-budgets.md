# Error Budgets

* Each development team has an allocated budget of x points per quarter
* Severity of production issues costs budget accordingly
  * More severe issues have a higher budget impact
* Requires a root cause analysis to be performed for production issues
  * Some teams may not deal with production support at all
  * Neutral party must perform attribution as part of root cause analysis
  * Attribution must be published to organization for all to see
* Inspired by Site Reliability Engineering
